## Introduction
Gigpond is a simple and well-organized job listing website built-in Bootstrap version 5.1.3.
Gigpond contains lots of new designs of jobs pages with responsiveness on all screens.
I have written minimum SCSS and codes to increase performance.
This is a Python3/Django project so you have to make sure the Python installed primarily and running in your computer.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me on ovorshylo3@gmail.com

### Tips
`SCSS:` I suggest you not to do any changes in any scss files from `src/scss/custom` folders because it will trouble in future updates so I am suggesting that if you want to make any changes you can create a new `custom.scss` file and use that instead of the theme's file.
